# To compile and run the game on DOSBOX, follow these:
### 1. Download and Install NASM (Netwide Assembler)

### 3. Get the Haribird’s Tiny Wing Escape Source Code
Download or clone the Haribird source code from the official source.
### 4. Move the Folder to Drive C
For easier access, place the Haribird folder in Drive C.
### 5. Assemble the Source Code
Once everything is ready: <br>
• Open the command prompt or terminal where NASM is available. <br>
• Then, compile the source code using this command: <br>

nasm fbird.asm -o fbird.com -l fbird.lst

```
fbird.com
```
file, which is the runnable version of the game.
